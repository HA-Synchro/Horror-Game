3. The Distant Figure

    - Sometimes visible from:

        - The window (across the street).

        - Reflections (mirror, turned-off TV).

        - Photographs taken with a camera (optional).

    - The figure never moves on-screen â€” only changes location between events or when unseen.

    - Player cannot interact with it directly.
