You’ve just moved into a new apartment. Everything feels fine — except sometimes, through the window, you see someone staring from the apartment across the street. But nobody lives there.


### Ervin's story

You are ervin and your parents always leave you alone at home, you see halucinations of monsters and therefore prevent them from killing you.

You gotta somehow pass these 5 days. 
*sighs*


(after each day, you get a optimistic message from parents :C cuz they love u)
