You’ve just moved into a new apartment. Everything feels fine — except sometimes, through the window, you see someone staring from the apartment across the street. But nobody lives there.


### Ervin's story

You are ervin and your parents always leave you alone at home, you see halucinations of monsters and therefore prevent them from killing you.

You gotta somehow pass these 5 days. 
*sighs*


(after each day, you get a optimistic message from parents :C cuz they love u)


#### maybe
Parents are with you in the morning but they both work at a company where they have to work at night and therefore leave you all alone at home during night.
(You as a child hate it)

you feel disconnected from parents
bcz they always leave u alone
its as if they dont care
yet they do care
