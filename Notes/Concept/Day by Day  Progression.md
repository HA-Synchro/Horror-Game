### 2. **Day-by-Day Progression**

- The game progresses through **in-game days** (e.g., 5–7 days).
    
- Each “day,” the apartment subtly changes:
    
    - Furniture slightly moved.
        
    - Different messages on mirror condensation.
        
    - New sounds or distant figures visible outside the window.
        
- The player wakes up and continues exploring — tension slowly builds.
