# Man from the window.

In the bedroom window, a man first opens the window and then comes inside the house and kills you.

(he appears to be standing at the window for sometime before coming inside)

You can scare him away using the flashlight and then lock the door.

# Bloody Tub
(might not need this)

In the washroom the tub slowly fills up with blood, when its completely filled a red weird stag-like monster comes out of it. You can scare him using the flashlight and then drain all the blood.

# Eyes under the bed

2 eyes stare at you from under the bed, you can use your flashlight, which scares the monster for sometime.

If you don't use the flashlight for some time, the monster comes out and climbs the roof and kills you the next time you enter the bedroom.

# Toy from closet
A weird toy comes out of the closet and slowly moves towards the kitchen to grab a knife (he only moves when u are not looking at him)

You can pick him up and put him inside the closet.

If he reaches the kitchen he picks a knife and then kills you.

He is not dangerous until he has gotten the knife

# Malfunctioned TV

The TV is not right, it automatically turns on and consumes so much electricity that the light of the home starts fluctoating and then turn off.

You should turn this off to prevent it from lights going down.

# Door knocker

A man comes and knocks at the door, he asks if there is anyone home, you have to use the pre-recorded voice of father.

When he listens to the voice, he thinks there are adults inside home and therefore goes away.

If not done, he will break the door and then proceed to kill you.

You have a weird type of audio player which u always carry, it doesnt need batteries cuz we gotta make the game ez.


***NOTE:*** *All this incidents happen at random intervals and more enemies start appearing the more nights you pass.*
